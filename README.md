# Huff Proxy
A minimal Ethereum delegate-call proxy implemented in [Huff](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/AZTEC/tree/master/packages/huff). A slow work in progress, and definitely not ready for usage yet. Contributions welcome, or feel free to fork and make it your own.

## Usage
`npm install`

#### Run tests
`npm run test`

#### Compile bytecode
`npm run compile`
